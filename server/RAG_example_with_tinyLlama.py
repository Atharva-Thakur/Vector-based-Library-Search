# Your input query
query = '''Context:
Marie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist, best known for her work on radioactivity. Born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, Curie moved to Paris to pursue her studies at the Sorbonne, where she met her husband, Pierre Curie. Together, they discovered the elements polonium and radium. Marie Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and she is the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fieldsâ€”Physics in 1903 (shared with her husband and Henri Becquerel) and Chemistry in 1911 for her work on radium and polonium.
Consider the context and answer the following context

Question:
For which scientific discovery did Marie Curie receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911?

Answer:
'''
